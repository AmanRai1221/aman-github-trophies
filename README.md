# 🏆 Custom GitHub Profile Trophies

I have built an engine to generate dynamic GitHub trophies for your profile README. Built with Node.js and Express.

## 🚀 How to Use (Free for Everyone)

Once this project is deployed anyone can use it by adding the following markdown to their GitHub profile `README.md`:

```markdown
[![My Trophies](https://aman-github-trophies.vercel.app/api?username=THEIR_USERNAME&theme=onedark)](https://github.com/AmanRai1221/github-trophies-custom)
```

### 🎨 Customization

- **username**: Your GitHub username (Required)
- **theme**: `onedark` (default) or `light`

### Example

If your username is **john_doe**, you would use:
`https://.../api?username=john_doe`
